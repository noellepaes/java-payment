Overview of Stripe Integration

* To integrate Stripe with Spring Boot, we will use Stripe's API to create
a Checkout Session, which securely handles payment processing. The
integration involves the following steps:

* 1. Setup Stripe in your Spring Boot backend.

* 2. Create a Checkout Session using Stripe's API.

* 3. Frontend uses Stripe.js to redirect users to the hosted payment
page.

* 4. Users complete the payment, and Stripe returns the status.
